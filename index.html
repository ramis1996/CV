   <h2>Summary</h2>
   <p>
      I am an architect with a keen interest in various aspects of architecture, including urban planning, interior design, and product design. I draw inspiration from every stage of the design process, from initial sketches to the final realization of projects.
   </p>
   <p>
      Having obtained a Master's degree in Urban Planning from the University of Architecture, Civil Engineering, and Geodesy in Sofia, my portfolio showcases a blend of academic and professional experiences. While my academic projects lean towards conceptual exploration, my professional endeavors focus mainly on residential buildings, with some already completed and others currently in progress.
   </p>
   <p>
      In my approach to architecture, I prioritize the balance between functionality, harmony, and aesthetics, ensuring that each design serves its intended purpose effectively while also being visually appealing.
